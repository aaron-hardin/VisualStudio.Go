# VisualStudio.Go

VisualStudio.Go is a Visual Studio extension that aims to provide full IDE support for Go in the IDE everyone knows and loves.

### Important Notes
If you are looking at this project to learn more about Visual Studio Extensions, that will be a bit complicated. Some of the projects here have custom csproj files as an example that must be manually edited. Best of luck though!
 
Visual Studio.Go.Build places some files in the '$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\Go\1.0\' path, so installing the VSIX generated by the solution is not the only thing that needs to be done to install.

### Current features
  - Build application
  - Use a template to start a Go project
  - Add files to project (item templates)

### Future features
  - Extended templates
  - Intellisense
  - Syntax Highlighting (for now I reccomend [Visual Studio Go Support][vs go])
  - Debugging
  - Installer (deploying build tasks)
